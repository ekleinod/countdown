# countdown

countdown is a Java program that provides a countdown clock.

It counts time down, showing the clock an a freely editable text. When the clock reaches zero, the program closes, or counts up, depending on your settings.

The program is useful for starting presentations, mettings, or other short-termed events.

See [Wiki](../../wiki) for more information.

The basic code is derived from [sourceforge project countdown](http://sourceforge.net/projects/countdown/)
